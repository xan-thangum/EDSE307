# My ideal classroom

## What would my dream classroom look like?
If I were given the ability to pick any room in the school and a blank check for buying furniture, my classroom wouldn’t look like the photo above. So what would my dream classroom look like? That’s a surprisingly hard question to answer. 

My first thought is that my dream classroom would mitigate issues I run into when delivering lessons, mapping some of them out might be a good start. 


  > **Common issues**

  * Students arriving late to class
  * Moving desks for group work
  * Adequate numbers of power outlets 


In high school computer science, students will move around to talk with their peers and rearrange furniture to collaborate on problems and projects. Sometimes this can cause issues when there aren’t enough power outlets. Students will crowd around the available outlets, and depending on the classroom this can cause bunching and unused space. The furniture itself may almost be difficult to move.  Many students now have their own laptops and don’t use school computers as much. Standardization isn’t an issue until students create a term project. Most of the coding is done online through resources like code.org.

Looking at some of the most frequent issues has given us an idea of what our classroom should look like, but the image of an ideal classroom is still fuzzy. It could help to look at photos of study spaces, classrooms, and labs to look at what’s done well and what needs to be modified. 


### Exploring learning spaces

I spent a lot of time studying in the computer science labs. A big reason was the access to outlets and table space. When working in groups, I sat beside the people I was working with. If there wasn’t enough space we would have to find a new space that could accommodate everyone.
