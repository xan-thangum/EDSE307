# My ideal classroom

## What would my dream classroom look like?
If I were given the ability to pick any room in the school and a blank check for buying furniture, my classroom wouldn’t look like the photo above. So what would my dream classroom look like? That’s a surprisingly hard question to answer. 

My first thought is that my dream classroom would mitigate issues I run into when delivering lessons, mapping some of them out might be a good start. 


  > **Common issues**

  * Students arriving late to class
  * Moving desks for group work
  * Adequate numbers of power outlets 


In high school computer science, students will move around to talk with their peers and rearrange furniture to collaborate on problems and projects. Sometimes this can cause issues when there aren’t enough power outlets. Students will crowd around the available outlets, and depending on the classroom this can cause bunching and unused space. The furniture itself may almost be difficult to move.  Many students now have their own laptops and don’t use school computers as much. Standardization isn’t an issue until students create a term project. Most of the coding is done online through resources like code.org.

Looking at some of the most frequent issues has given us an idea of what our classroom should look like, but the image of an ideal classroom is still fuzzy. It could help to look at photos of study spaces, classrooms, and labs to look at what’s done well and what needs to be modified. 


### Exploring learning spaces

I spent a lot of time studying in the computer science labs when I attended the University of Calgary. A big reason was the access to outlets and table space. When working in groups, I sat beside the people I was working with. If there wasn’t enough space we would have to find a new space that could accommodate everyone.

 The University of Alberta computer labs are similar to the University of Calgary computer labs. But they have coat racks at the back to help free up clutter.

The computer science labs at the University of Calgary were recently renovated. All tables now have power outlets and there are mobile whiteboards to help students communicate their ideas while working in groups.

This classroom is almost ideal. The power outlet issue is solved with hanging outlets for the round tables, and integrated outlets in the rectangular tables. The round tables are also great for group work. Another bonus is many of the chairs have rollers making it easier for students to move around. 

However, the layout of the room isn’t flexible, the chairs can be uncomfortable, and the room is a multi-purpose space so it’s cluttered, but it acts as a good blueprint for my ideal class. 

### The mockup

This mockup would be my ideal classroom, but with coat hangers near the door and outlet extension cords hanging from the ceiling.  The chairs, tables and whiteboards have rollers to make rearranging furniture easier. The entrance to the class is at the back so late students can enter the classroom with minimal interruption. Instead of fixed lab computers, there would be laptops available to the students stored on the shelves near the teacher's desk.

This is an example of how the furniture can be rearranged for a lesson requiring group work. Students can quickly move their tables into groups.

Students will be able to rearrange the furniture in a way that benefits them during open work classes. The teacher is also able to move their desk. In this case, the teacher is in the centre of the room for easier access.
